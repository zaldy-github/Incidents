# incidents
The Incidents Project is a web application built around a fake API.  The API exposes methods to retrieve mock data.  The data is loaded on to a HTML table and rendered on a web page.<br/><br/>
The Project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.  It also leverages the jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks as well as the Node.js platform.<br/><br/>
The application was developed and tested on a Windows 10 64-bit device, using http-server (over Node.js), a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server.  It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.<br/>
